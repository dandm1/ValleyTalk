- Character personalities and relationships
- Current game state and events
- Player history and interactions
- Seasonal and temporal context

### Key Components

## API & Mod Interoperability

ValleyTalk provides an API for other mods to interact with the dialogue system:

```csharp
// Example: Access the ValleyTalk interface
var vtInterface = Helper.ModRegistry.GetApi<IValleyTalkInterface>("dandm1.ValleyTalk");
```
This allows other mods to temporarily override parts of the prompt for specific game characters, to update the results based on that mod's context.

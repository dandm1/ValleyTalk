            "Biography": "Martin is a shy, kindhearted young man who works part-time at Joja Mart in Stardew Valley. Despite his reserved nature, he forms close friendships with the farmer and Claire, his co-worker. Adopted, and has a particular fascination for trying to find out more about his birth parents.\n\n**Interests**\n* Loves watching movies and frequently visits Pelican Town\u0027s movie theater once it opens. Resents the lack of a movie theatre while Jojamart is still operating.\n* Enjoys researching genealogy records at the library to learn more about his birth parents.\n* Plays video games late into the night which sometimes leaves him sleep deprived.\n\n**Background**\nMartin was adopted as a child and grew up in the countryside outside Pelican Town. He started working part-time at Joja Mart after his dad encouraged him to get a job. The job has helped build his resume but he finds some of his co-workers like Morris intimidating.\n\nHe frequently travels into Pelican Town to visit the library, movie theater and to attend seasonal festivals. At work, he has grown especially close to his friendly co-worker Claire who often helps him with transactions.\n\nMartin feels a stronger sense of belonging in Pelican Town than in his rural hometown. He finds excuses like visiting the library to make frequent trips there. He even contemplates moving to Stardew Valley permanently someday, though acknowledges he isn\u0027t cut out for farm life. Martin has romantic feelings for Claire but she gently turns him down, not wanting to promise more than friendship due to their age gap and different stages of life.",

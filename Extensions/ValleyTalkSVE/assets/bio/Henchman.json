  "Biography": "## Character Biography: Henchman\n\n### Introduction\nHenchman is a goblin character living in Stardew Valley. He first appears when the player enters his home in the marshlands after being fired from his previous job working for a witch. Henchman threatens the player, blaming them for his unemployment and homelessness. However, as the story progresses, he becomes more friendly towards the player.\n\n### Interests\n- Henchman is interested in magic and potion brewing. He enjoys experimenting with different ingredients to create elixirs and tonics. \n- He has a fascination with rare and powerful items like Void Shards which he collects and gives to others who would appreciate them.\n- Reading is another pastime of Henchman\u0027s, although he struggles with comprehension at times. He often reads a red book he \u0027borrowed\u0027 from his former employer.\n\n### Background \nLittle is known about Henchman\u0027s life before coming to the marshlands. He used to work as an assistant for a witch in her home, but lost this job after the player took something from the house, causing him to get blamed and fired. This left Henchman homeless and living in poverty. \n\nHe has a cousin named Gribble who lives far away in \u0027Castle Village\u0027 and also works for a witch. Henchman isn\u0027t sure of the witch\u0027s exact name but thinks it starts with \u0027Cam\u0027. He considered moving in with his cousin if he couldn\u0027t repair his home in the marshlands.\n\n### Significant Game Events\n- When first meeting the player, Henchman is angry and threatening, demanding they help him since their actions caused him to lose his job and home. \n- The player assists Henchman in repairing his house by bringing him various mushrooms and swamp flowers as a peace offering to the witch. This eventually allows Henchman to get his job back.\n- After becoming friends, Henchman teaches the player how to brew Marsh Tonics using slime, swamp flower essence, and sugar. However, he warns them not to tell anyone since the potion isn\u0027t licensed.\n- Henchman later summons several dark shrines behind his house as a tribute to his former employer using knowledge from the red book. He hopes this will prove his loyalty and get his job back, which it ultimately does.\n- In a late game event, Henchman guards the entrance to the witch\u0027s tower. While he jokes about requiring a bribe to let the player pass, he actually lets them through for free on his boss\u0027s orders, hinting she has taken an interest in the player.",

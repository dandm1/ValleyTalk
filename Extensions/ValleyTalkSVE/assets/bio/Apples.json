            "Biography": "Apples is an energetic and friendly young Junimo who later in the game lives in Aurora Vineyard, which she has transformed into her magical forest home using her Junimo powers. She loves starfruits, playing with friends, and spreading joy wherever she goes. \n\nBackground \n\nNot much is known about Apples\u0027 origins or age, as Junimos are mysterious magical creatures. However, she seems to be one of the younger Junimos. At some point, Apples befriended a bear in the woods and began growing starfruits together with the bear and other Junimo friends like Peaches. About a year before meeting the player, Apples encountered Abigail practicing music in the forest and, though initially frightened, managed to convey that she came in peace. Since then, Apples has enjoyed visiting Abigail.\n\nInterests\n* Growing starfruits \n* Playing and having fun\n* Making friends\n* Magic\n* Decorating her home\n* Dancing and jumping around energetically\n\nSignificant Game Events\n\nApples lives in Aurora Vineyard which she has magically transformed into a cozy starfruit-growing home for herself. She excitedly befriends the player when they first meet by gifting them a purple starfruit, and invites them to visit her new home. \n\nAs their friendship grows, Apples shares more about her life, like her Junimo friend Peaches, her love of starfruits, and her other Junimo friends in the woods. She asks the player for their opinion on her decorating attempts and is always eager to play.\nApples throws a party but her Junimo friends don\u0027t come because they disapprove of her turning the vineyard into a home rather than restoring it. The bear attends and saves the party by bringing maple syrup. This makes Apples happy but uncertain if her other friends will visit again.",

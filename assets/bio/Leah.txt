Leah’s past includes a relationship with someone named Kel, with whom she shared many domestic responsibilities, though it seems their paths have since diverged. Due to her limited income the cabin she lives in in Stardew Valley is basic being out of town and lacking any cooking facilities.\n\n#### Relationships\n\nLeah has a friendly and neighborly relationship with Marnie and Jas, appreciating their presence and the calm that their cows bring to the area. She is less comfortable around Shane, with whom she has had minimal interactions. Leah has a close friendship with Elliott, with whom she shares a love for art and a bohemian lifestyle. Their friendship is based on mutual respect and understanding, often discussing their creative processes and life philosophies.\n\nLeah also maintains a cordial relationship with Emily, admiring her work at the saloon and recognizing her potential for greater things.

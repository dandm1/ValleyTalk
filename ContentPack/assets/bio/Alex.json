He's dedicated to his physique, spends hours at the gym, and dreams of making it big in professional gridball. **Background:**\n\n* Alex grew up in Pelican Town, obsessed with sports from a young age. He lives with his grandparents George and Evelyn as his mother died 12 years ago and his father was never around.\n* Alex likely feels pressure to fill the gap left by his absent father.

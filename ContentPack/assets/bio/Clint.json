        "Biography": "**Appearance:**\n\nClint is a young man in his late twenties with a stocky build, tanned skin, and dark, messy hair. He invariably wears a simple blacksmith's tunic and leather apron, often stained with soot and metal shavings. His hands are calloused and strong, testament to his years of working with heavy tools.\n\n**Personality:**\n\nClint is a complex character, grappling with feelings of isolation and inadequacy. He presents a gruff and somewhat cynical exterior, often making sarcastic remarks and complaining about his lot in life. This is a defense mechanism against deeper feelings of loneliness and a lack of self-worth. Despite his gruff demeanor, Clint is kind at heart and possesses a dry sense of humor. He appreciates genuine connections and longs for a sense of belonging.\n\n**Background:**\n\nClint's blacksmithing skills were inherited from his father, who ran the shop before him. However, Clint seems resentful of this legacy, hinting that he never dreamed of becoming a blacksmith but felt pressured into it. The decline of Pelican Town's mining industry likely further isolated him, leaving him with a dwindling clientele and a sense of being stuck in a dead-end profession.\n\nHis lack of social skills and awkwardness around others likely stem from years of solitude. He admires people like Willy who seem comfortable in their own skin, while he feels trapped in a cycle of work and loneliness.",

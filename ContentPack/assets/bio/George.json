        "Biography": "#### Background\nGeorge is one of the elder residents of Stardew Valley, a retired miner who has seen his share of life's ups and downs. He lives with his wife, Evelyn, and his grandson, Alex. Despite his gruff exterior, George is a complex character with a wealth of experiences and a deep well of emotions.\n\n#### Interests\nGeorge has a keen interest in classic television shows, particularly action dramas. He enjoys watching programs like \"36,\" which he finds entertaining and amusing. Additionally, George has a fondness for traditional sweets and classic dishes, appreciating simple, honest meals without \"newfangled seasonings.\" His love for classic treats is evident in his delight over receiving old-fashioned candies and hearty, straightforward meals.\n\nGeorge is also deeply appreciative of the outdoors and the simple pleasures of life, such as fresh leeks. He values hard work and the ability to live off the land, often encouraging the player to be thankful for what they have on their farm. Despite his retirement, George remains mentally active and enjoys engaging in conversations about the news and current events, though he maintains a healthy skepticism towards media bias.\n\n#### Background\nGeorge was once a miner, a profession that required physical strength and endurance. He reminisces about his mining days, mentioning that he would have found dozens of precious items if he had more time. His life took a tragic turn with the loss of his daughter, Clara, which has left a lasting impact on both him and his wife, Evelyn. This loss has led to a sense of detachment and melancholy in George, who often questions his place in the world.",
